The recordings of Mike Abou were by Sharon Hargus on a Sony WM-D6C
cassette recorder.  Free translations of sentences are by Mary
Charlie, Edna McCook, Eileen McCook, Mike Abou and Sharon Hargus.
Transcription and word glosses are by Sharon Hargus.
</p><p style="font-size:20px;padding:0px 30px -5px 30px">
Occasionally Mike would use a word or phrase of English in a sentence
as he was telling the story.  Whenever possible, within-sentence
English has been translated into Tsek'ene by Mary, Edna and Eileen and
are provided here for the reader.
</p><p style="font-size:20px;padding:0px 30px -5px 30px">
Sometimes entire sentences which were thought necessary to understand
the plot were added by Mary etc.  These too are not on the accompanying
audio recording as they were not part of Mike's original telling.
These Tsek'ene sentences are presented here in a different color font.
